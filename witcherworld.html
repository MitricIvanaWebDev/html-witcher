            <p>The Witcher short stories by the author Andrzej Sapkowski were first published in Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine Fantastyka, beginning in the mid-1980s.<br>The first short story, "Wiedźmin" ("The Witcher") (1986), was written for a contest held by the magazine and won third place.<br>The first four stories dealing with the witcher Geralt of Rivia were originally featured in a 1990 short story collection titled Wiedźmin (The Witcher) — now out of print — with "Droga, z której się nie wraca" ("The Road with No Return"), which is set before the Witcher stories and features Geralt's mother-to-be.The second published short story collection was Sword of Destiny (orig. Miecz przeznaczenia).<br> Although The Last Wish (orig. Ostatnie życzenie) was published after Sword of Destiny, it replaced The Witcher as the first book since it included all the stories in The Witcher, except "The Road with No Return" (the only story without Geralt).<br> Although new short stories were added to The Last Wish, they took place before those in Sword of Destiny.Although "The Road with No Return" and "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna" ("Something Ends, Something Begins", an alternate ending of the Witcher saga about Geralt and Yennefer's wedding written as a wedding gift for Sapkowski's friends) were later published in 2000 in Something Ends, Something Begins and in 2012 in Maladie and Other Stories (Maladie i inne opowiadania) collections, the other stories in those books are unconnected to the Witcher series.<br> In some Polish editions, "The Road with No Return" and "Something Ends, Something Begins" are added to The Last Wish or Sword of Destiny.</p>

                <p>The Witcher is a TV series exclusive to Netflix, based on the Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski, who serves as a creative consultant on the show.<br> It was announced on May 17, 2017, and its first season was released on December 20, 2019.<br>
                In December 2017, it was announced that Lauren Schmidt Hissrich will be the series' showrunner. In January 2018, Lauren Hissrich tweeted that the script for the pilot episode was finished.<br>
                The first season was filmed in Hungary, Austria, Poland, and the Canary Islands. Principal photography began on October 31, 2018 and wrapped in May 2019.<br>
                In Hungary, many scenes were filmed at Malfilm Studios and Origo Studios near Budapest including the town of Blaviken as well as interior scenes in Cintra and Aretuza.<br> Fort Monstor in Komárom was used for exterior scenes depicting the Slaughter of Cintra.
                Filming occurred at Tata Castle to represent a part of Rinde from The Last Wish. Additional filming locations in Hungary include Szelim Cave, Jaki Chapel, Kiscelli Museum, Skazen Village Museum, and Tarnok Quarry.<br>
                The exteriors of Kreuzenstein Castle near Leobendorf, Austria were used to represent the abandoned castle Vizima in Temeria. The Battle of Sodden Hill was filmed at Ogrodzienic Castle in Poland and Egri vár másolata in Hungary. For the Canary Islands, scenes were shot on Gran Canaria, La Palma, and La Gomera.<br>
                In November 2019, before the first season even premiered, it was announced the show was already renewed for a second season and would begin production in London in early 2020, with a planned debut in 2021.
                On August 26, 2020, Netflix released a 32 minute documentary, Making The Witcher, that gave behind-the-scenes insight into how the first season was made.
