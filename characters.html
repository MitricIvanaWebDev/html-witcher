                <h1>} Geralt of RIvia <br> The witcher }</h1>
                <p>Geralt is a witcher. Shortly after being born, Geralt's mother, Visenna, gave him away to undergo training and, eventually, become a witcher at Kaer Morhen - the stronghold of the witchers. Geralt survived mutations during the Trial of the Grasses, thanks to which he gained various witcher traits: high resistance to injury, poison and disease, slowed ageing, but also infertility.<br><br> He resisted the "changes" brought on by the Trial of Grasses better than most, which encouraged his makers to perform even more dangerous experimental procedures on him, making him lose all body pigmentation. Because of his pale skin and white hair, he is also known in the Elder Speech as "Gwynbleidd", the White Wolf. From the arduous training of Witchers, he became a master swordfighter and learnt how to use the Signs, simple spells used by the witchers.<br><br>

                Despite his name, Geralt does not come from Rivia (although he learned how to mimic a Rivian accent and is later knighted for services to the queen of Rivia): young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir, to make their names sound more trustworthy. He once claimed that his first choice was Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde, but this was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious.
                    
                After completing his witcher training, he received his Wolf medallion (the symbol of Kaer Morhen) and embarked into the world on his horse called Płotka (literally, "Roach" ; he gave the same name to every horse he owned) to become a monster slayer for hire. </p>

                <h1>Yennefer of Vengerburg <br>& "YENN" &</h1>
                <p> Yennefer of Vengerberg (born on Belleteyn of the year 1173) — a sorceress who lived in the capital city of Aedirn - Vengerberg. She was the youngest member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and later the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her. She was the love of the witcher Geralt of Rivia and a mother figure to Ciri, a former royal advisor to king Demavend of Aedirn and a close friend of Triss Merigold.<br><br> The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though during the events of The Tower of the Swallow she was 94 years old. Yennefer had lots of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, falling in a cascade of curls on the shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape showing slightly receded chin.<br><br> Her eyes were cold and sparkling with remarkable violet of a penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly too long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On a long and slender neck hanged a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.</p>

                <p>Ciri is a source, someone born with innate (and likely enormous) magical powers. She makes her first appearance in The Witcher 3, so all of her backstory comes from the Andrzej Sapkowski novels. She is the daughter of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard. As a child, after both her parents are believed to be dead, Geralt takes Ciri to Kaer Morhen to train as a witcher.<br><br> She later brings Geralt and Yennefer back to life using her magical powers, before teleporting herself out of the world of The Witcher into another realm. At the beginning of The Witcher 3, she has apparently returned and is somewhere in the Northern Kingdoms, pursued by the Wild Hunt for her powers as a source.<br><br>Ciri was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year[6] and initially, Calanthe ordered her advisor Mousesack to kill Geralt, wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise. Mousesack was ready to go, as nobody simply refused the queen, but when he was summoned a short time later Calanthe retracted the order without explanation.</p>

                <p>In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Dandelion is a bard, poet, professor, spy, and gentleman. He studied at Oxenfurt where his favorite subject was geography due to the fact that the books for that class were large enough that he could hide vodka behind them."Born in 1229, a talented poet and troubadour, a graduate of Oxenfurt Academy, a frequent performer at royal courts, an unequaled lover appreciated, and in some cases adored, by ladies worldwide, a skilled negotiator and a stirring orator" — such is the image of the bard Dandelion as painted by his friends and promoters.<br><br>Dandelion is one of Geralt's closest friends and has travelled with the Witcher on several occasions, some times followed by the third member of their party, Zoltan. Although the bard thinks highly of the Witcher he rarely expresses it in public, primarily due to the fact that he himself is a man of peculiar reputation and fears that his involvement with the notorious hunter of monsters would garner him the hatred and spite of powerful indiviuals and that of the general public.<br><br> Things being what they are though and as timid as he might appear, Dandelion has often been involved with politics on an intimate level, a practice that has brought him close to many monarchs in the past, serving as a spy or royal minstrel on occasion.</p>

                <p>Triss is one of the major characters in The Witcher computer game. She is one of the first people Geralt meets after being found unconscious in the woods by fellow witchers, who are quite possibly, some of the last witchers in the world. After dealing with the Salamandra invasion of Kaer Morhen, Triss is gravely wounded and requires a special potion that Geralt must brew to help her recover. After drinking the potion, she offers Geralt his first sexual encounter of the game.<br><br> She is also the one to nurse Geralt back health after his first battle with Azar Javed in the Swamp. Once Geralt regains consciousness, he finds himself in the bedroom of her luxurious Trade Quarter home, and he sees her talking presumably to another sorceress. She diligently "checks him for internal injuries".<br><br>A powerful sorceress and Geralt’s on-again, off-again lover. Triss is a friend to the witchers and sometimes stays with them at Kaer Morhen. She saves Geralt’s life more than once in The Witcher 1, and again plays a key role in The Witcher 2. She is kidnapped by the kingslayer witcher Letho, and her fate is up to Geralt’s actions. At the beginning of the Witcher 3, she and Geralt are separated, as Geralt is riding across the Northern Kingdoms in search of Yennefer.<br><br></p>

                <p>Lambert appears in the main campaign of The Witcher, as well as The Price of Neutrality premium module. Despite not being fond of her, when Triss was sick and wounded after a fight with a wizard, Lambert cared for her helping to nurse her back to health. Vesemir suggests this might be because he feels guilty.In The Witcher, he is wandering around the ground floor of Kaer Morhen or busy in the courtyard for the duration of the Prologue.<br><br>One of the younger witchers, Lambert is foul-mouthed, loves a drink, but is also highly talented. Lambert only appears occasionally in The Witcher 3, but each time is memorable due to his personality. Interestingly, Lambert is a witcher who adamantly dislikes his trade, and is not quiet about this.<br><br>He’s also pretty jealous of Geralt and his fame. Not to mention the fact that Geralt gets to mix with royalty. Due to this, and his pretty difficult childhood, Lambert drinks. A lot. But he’s very dedicated to the cause of finding Ciri, and provides some of the best interactions for Geralt. He may be a difficult man, but it wasn’t a difficult decision to add Lambert to this list. Geralt also makes up a beautiful limerick about Lambert.</p>

                <p>Vesemir was the oldest and most experienced witcher at Kaer Morhen in the 13th century and acted as a father figure to Geralt and the other witchers. Like many of the other witchers, he spent each winter in the fortress and set out on the path when spring arrived.He was one of the few members of the School of the Wolf to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. By the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; however, as he was only a fencing instructor, he didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples into witchers.<br><br>Vesemiris one of the most respected and skilled witchers at Kaer Morhen. Due to his age he becomes a father figure to Geralt, and plays a big role in training Ciri. He is also present from the very opening of the game where Geralt is trying to find Yennefer, and he even helps Geralt take down a griffin.<br><br>Vesemir is a kind-hearted and noble man, always willing to help Geralt when needed. This was most notable when the Wild Hunt invaded Kaer Morhen and attacked those inside. Vesemir battled bravely, but eventually fell, and this led to one of the most emotional scenes in the whole of The Witcher 3. Vesemir stands out for so many reasons, and is a character who will always be remembered.</p>
